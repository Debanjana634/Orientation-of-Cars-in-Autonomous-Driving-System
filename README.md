# Orientation of Cars in Autonomous Driving System

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores the problem of predicting the **orientation of cars** in the context of autonomous driving. Correctly estimating vehicle orientation is critical for self-driving cars to make safe and reliable decisions during navigation, lane switching, and collision avoidance.  

The notebook applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and classify car orientations from image datasets.
